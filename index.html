        <h4 style="font-size: 15pt;">Temperatures are freezing in many parts of the<strong>UK</strong> and are set to drop even lower as the week goes on.

        <p>
            Fuel use and bills are likely to rise, and with more people at home under lockdown, those bills could grow very steeply.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, there is help on hand for people receiving benefits, in the form of <a href="google.com">Cold Weather Payments from the government.</a>
        </p>



        <h2>Who are Cold Weather Payments for?</h2>
        <p>Cold Weather Payments are a government benefit top-up to help with fuel bills during times of exceptional cold weather.</p>
        <p>These payments are not age-related. To qualify, you must already be eligible for one of five benefits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pension Credit </li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Income Support</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Income-based Job Seekers Allowance</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
            &nbsp;
            <li>Universal Credit - although there are certain exceptions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each Cold Weather Payment is paid for a seven-day period and is worth £25. </p>
        <p>The scheme covers the period between 1 November and 31 March each year.</p>
        <p>Hospital stays can affect payments, while benefit offices also want to know if you've had a baby or if a child under five lives with you.</p>
        <p>
            <a href="#" target="blank">To see if you are eligible, check on the government site, here.</a>
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <h2>How are the payments triggered?</h2>
        <p>
            The average temperature must be zero degrees Celsius - or less - for seven days in a row.

        </p>
        <p> temperature needs to be recorded by the weather station nearest to your postcode.</p>

        <p>/p>So far this year, there have been 58 cold weather triggers from the 95 weather stations in England Wales and Scotland.

        </p>

        <p> Ireland has seven weather stations it uses to trigger its cold weather payments.</p>
        <p>
            In England, Scotland and Wales, 705,000 Cold Weather Payments have been made: 341,000 in England, 305,000 in Scotland and 59,000 in Wales.

            <h2><b>How does this differ from the Winter Fuel Payment?</b></h2>
        </p>

        <p>
            The Winter Fuel Payment is a different benefit, paid out to pensioners.</p>

        <p> 11.4 million pensioners receive that benefit, which is between £100 and £300, regardless of weather conditions. </p>
        <p> calculated according to age and whether you live alone.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How do I get them and how long does it take?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The good news is, you don't have to do anything in order to get them.</p>

        <p>>As the system knows all about you anyway, payments arrive automatically and are paid straight into your bank account within two weeks.</p>

        <p>Each period of very cold weather in your area should trigger a payment. It's paid into the same bank or building society account as your benefit payments.
            <p>

                Cold Weather Payments do not affect your other benefits.</p>
            <p>

                If you do not receive your Cold Weather Payment, tell the pension centre or Jobcentre Plus office.
