<p>now let's talk about <strong>Bigger Headings</strong> Each HTML has a default sixe. However, you can specify the size of for any heading with the <mark>style attribute</mark> using the css- <mark>Font-size</mark> property: here is an example below.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
<h1 style="color:green">Heading 1</h1>
<h1 style="font-family:stylish;">Heading 1</h1>
<P>So far So Good, Now let's move on the adding horizontal lines which is a tag called hr, it is used to separe content in a HTML page</P>
<hr>
<p style="color:yellow;">As you can see i'vee add a line break to the HTML page.</p>
<p>That being done let's try the preformatted text also know as pre it is usally used for poems, it's preserves both space and line breaks:</p>
    <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the moon.
        My Bonnie lies over the sea.
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
        oh, bring back my bonnie to me.
    </pre>
    <p>Further more, i can also style the body with the style attribute,i will just put that in the body section</p>
</body>
