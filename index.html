<p>now let's talk about <strong>Bigger Headings</strong> Each HTML has a default sixe. However, you can specify the size of for any heading with the <mark>style attribute</mark> using the css- <mark>Font-size</mark> property: here is an example below.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>
<h1 style="color:green">Heading 1</h1>
<h1 style="font-family:stylish;">Heading 1</h1>
<P>So far So Good, Now let's move on the adding horizontal lines which is a tag called hr, it is used to separe content in a HTML page</P>
<hr>
<p style="color:yellow;">As you can see i'vee add a line break to the HTML page.</p>
<p>That being done let's try the preformatted text also know as pre it is usally used for poems, it's preserves both space and line breaks:</p>
    <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the moon.
        My Bonnie lies over the sea.
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
        oh, bring back my bonnie to me.
    </pre>
    <p>Further more, i can also style the body with the style attribute,i will just put that in the body section</p>
    <P>Let's try adding a quotation to a sentence usig the q tag.</P>
    <p><q>This is the most memorable day of my life</q></p>
    <p>It's also possible to add an abbreviation to a text showing the full meaning of the word that is been written in short form.</p>
    <p> this <abbr title="world health organisation">WHO</abbr></p>
    <p>now we move on to written an address using the address tag called address which has an opening tag and a closing tag</p>
    <address>

        lekki, toll gate<br>
        NGR
    </address>
    <p>now when you want to title a picture that you put on your website or any where you would need the cite tag</p>
    <img src="img_the_scream.jpg" width="277" height="277" alt="the scream">
    <p><cite>The scream</cite>by gideon obisi. painted in 2021</p>
    <p>and also to turn a text for right to left you can do that by using the bdo tag which is called the bi-directional override</p>
    <bdo dir="rtl">this text will be written from right to left</bdo>
    <p>Now you can simply write a comment easily on an HTML Document using the following syntax below </p>
