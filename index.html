            <h3>Temperatures are freezing in many parts of the UK and are set to drop even lower as the week goes on.</h3>
            <p> Fuel use and bills are likely to rise, and with more people at home under lockdown, those bills could grow very steeply.</p>
            <p> However, there is help on hand for people receiving benefits, in the form of <hr> <a href=https://www.gov.uk/cold-weather-payment">Cold weather payment from the Goverment</a> </p>
            <h2>Who are Cold Weather Payments for?</h2>   
            <p> Cold Weather Payments are a government benefit top-up to help with fuel bills during times of exceptional cold weather. <br> These payments are not age-related. To qualify, you must already be eligible for one of five benefits and fulfil additional criteria -<a href="https://www.gov.uk/cold-weather-payment/eligibility">outline on the government website:</a> 
            <ul>
                <li>Pension Credit</li>
                <li>Income Support</li>
                <li>Income-based Job Seekers' Allowance</li>
                <li>Income-related Employment and Support Allowance</li>
                <li>Universal Credit - although there are certain exceptions</li>
              </ul> </p>
            <p> Each Cold Weather Payment is paid for a seven-day period and is worth £25.</p>
            <p> The scheme covers the period between 1 November and 31 March each year.</p>
            <p> Hospital stays can affect payments,<br> while benefit offices also want to know if you've had a baby or if a child under five lives with you.</p>
            <h1> How are the payments triggered?</h1>
            <p> The average temperature must be zero degrees Celsius - or less - for seven days in a row. </p>
            <p>This temperature needs to be recorded by the weather station nearest to your postcode. </p> 
            <p> So far this year, there have been 58 cold weather triggers from the 95 weather stations in England, Scotland and Wales. </p>
            <p> Northern Ireland has seven weather stations it uses to trigger its cold weather payments.</p> 
            <p> In England, Scotland and Wales, 705,000 Cold Weather Payments have been made: 341,000 in England, 305,000 in Scotland and 59,000 in Wales.</p>
            <p>You can check whether you're eligible by<a href="https://coldweatherpayments.dwp.gov.uk/"> entering the first part of your postcode here.</a> </p>

            <h2>How does this differ from the Winter Fuel Payment?</h2>
            <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment">The Winter Fuel Payment </a> is a different benefit, paid out to pensioners.</p>
            <p>All 11.4 million pensioners receive that benefit, which is between £100 and £300, regardless of weather conditions. <br> It is calculated according to age and whether you live alone.</p>
            <h2>How do I get them and how long does it take?</h3>
            <p>The good news is, you don't have to do anything in order to get them.</p>
            <p>As the system knows all about you anyway,<br> payments arrive automatically and are paid straight into your bank account within two weeks.</p>  
            <p>Each period of very cold weather in your area should trigger a payment. <br> It's paid into the same bank or building society account as your benefit payments.</p>
            <p>Cold Weather Payments do not affect your other benefits.</p>
            <p>If you do not receive your Cold Weather Payment, tell the pension centre or Jobcentre Plus office.</p>
